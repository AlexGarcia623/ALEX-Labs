# ALEX-Labs

Welcome to Astronomy Laboratory Exercises and eXperiments (ALEX)!

These computer labs were created for the AST1022 laboratory course at the University of Florida. 
These labs were based on the CLEA Labs originally created by Gettysburg College.

## Labs Available

 - You Can Weigh Jupiter
 - Astronomical Spectroscopy
   * Fraunhofer Lines from the Sun
   * Understanding the blackbody
   * Absorption Spectra 
 - Measure the Hubble Constant
 
## Usage of ALEX Labs

The ALEX software is free to use as you like! I just ask that you cite the work appropriately.
And, if you do end up using the material, please let me know! I'd love to hear how my work is helping your program.

### Version 1.0 -- August 18th, 2022

The ALEX labs are officially ready for student usage!
I anticipate needing to update *something* before students get their hands on it.

#### New in this version:

- You Can Weigh Jupiter
  * Use the motions of the Galilean moons of Jupiter to determine its mass!
- Astronomical Spectroscopy
  * Learn all about how bodies in our universe emit and absorb radiation
- Measure the Hubble Constant
  * Obtain an estimate of the expansion rate of the Universe!

#### Needs to be added to the next version

- Instructions (.pdf files) on how to use each lab along with a rough sketch of the worksheet associated with the lab
