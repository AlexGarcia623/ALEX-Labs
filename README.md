# ALEX-Labs

Welcome to Astronomy Laboratory Exercises and eXperiments (ALEX)!

These computer labs were created for the AST1022 laboratory course at the University of Florida. 
These labs were based on the Contemporary Labortory Experiences in Astronomy (CLEA) Labs originally created by Gettysburg College (see Acknowledgements).

## Labs Available

 - You Can Weigh Jupiter
 - Astronomical Spectroscopy
   * Fraunhofer Lines from the Sun
   * Absorption Spectra 
 - Measure the Hubble Constant
 - How Hot Is The Sun?
 - Space Weather
   * Links for online version of this lab

Other tools inside ALEX Labs:
 - Basic Unit Converter
 - Distance Modulus Calculator
   * This is useful for the "Measure the Hubble Constant" Lab
 - Energy and Wavelength Converter
   * This is useful for the "Astronomical Spectroscopy: Absorption Spectra" Lab
 
## Usage of ALEX Labs

The ALEX software is free to use as you like! I just ask that you cite the work appropriately.
And, if you do end up using the material, please let me know! I'd love to hear how my work is helping your program.
You can contact me at alexgarcia@ufl.edu

## Why do ALEX Labs exist?

This software was originally created in response to a simple issue: two of the three CLEA Labs used in the lab course software would no longer run on UF's Windows 10 machines. Seeing an opportunity to not only regain the functionality of the CLEA Labs (on which the Astronomy 1022L course depended) but to cater the software more directly to the course.

"The Flow of Energy Out of the Sun" and "Measure the Hubble Constant" CLEA Labs used in the lab course were prioritized. These labs were the biggest culprits of the Windows 10 non-functionality. While testing the waters on my ability to recreate these labs, I came to the conclusion that implementing all three CLEA labs could be recreated within my skill set.

Thus, the University of Florida Astronomy 1022L course gained its independence of the CLEA software. An added perk in this process is the projected longevity of these exercises. The CLEA Labs suffered as they aged since they were written in a language that, apparently, became obsolete several years down the road. ALEX Labs, developed in HTML/JS/CSS, aims to avoid this problem entirely by being entirely web-based, open-source, and in languages familiar to non-software developers.

## Do you plan to create more labs?

No, after Spring 2023 I no longer attend the University of Florida!

## Acknowledgements

ALEX Labs were inspired and originally based off of the Contemporary Labortory Experiences in Astronomy (CLEA) Labs, which were originally developed by Gettysburg College: http://public.gettysburg.edu/~marschal/clea/CLEAhome.html.

"You Can Weigh Jupiter" and "Measure the Hubble Constant" are nearly direct adaptations of the CLEA Labs of the same name. Minor changes, both in functionality and overall scope, were implemented for ALEX Labs, but as a whole they functional nearly identically to the CLEA Labs.

"Astronomical Spectroscopy: Absorption Spectra" is inspired by part of the CLEA Lab "The Flow of Energy Out of the Sun". The rest of "Astronomical Spectroscopy" (i.e. "Fraunhofer Lines from the Sun" and "Understanding the Blackbody", the latter is now "How Hot is the Sun?") arose naturally from the methology in which instructors taught the Astronomy 1022L course. 

Several images in this lab were taken directly from NASA websites and galleries. All image credits are given in appropriate places in their respective labs, please see each lab for respective credits and please contact me if you believe there to be an issue.

I would also like to acknowledge Dr. Paul Sell for his comments on improvements in both physical accuracy and lab functionality for nearly all of the labs in ALEX. Similarly, I would like to thank Dr. Triana Almeyda for her suggestsions and thoughts on what works well/does not work well on the new and improved version of the labs.

Finally, I would like to thank all the students I taught in 1022! All of this hard work was for you guys, I hope your interest in Astronomy continues well beyond my course! Thanks :)

## Final Version -- May 7th, 2023

### New in this version

- Minor quality of life upgrades (i.e., pop-ups now in the canvas elements).

This is (extremely) likely the final version that will be released for this. Any update requests should be sent to my email (linked on Github), and I will attempt to get to them as soon as possible.

## Version 1.2 -- April 5th, 2023

### New in this version

- Moved "Astronomical Spectroscopy: Understanding the Blackbody" to "How How is the Sun?" lab (portion of the new "The Sun" lab)
- Updated keyboard shortcuts to "Measuring the Hubble Constant"

## Version 1.1 -- August 25th, 2022

### New in this version

- Added colorblind friendly modes to the following color-based labs:
  * You Can Weigh Jupiter
    - Continuous Orbits
    - Timestep Orbits
  * Astronomical Spectroscopy
    - Absorption Spectra
- Added keyboard shortcuts for "Astronomical Spectroscopy: Absorption Spectra"

### Needs to be added to the next version

- Instructions (.pdf files) on how to use each lab along with a rough sketch of the worksheet associated with the lab 
- Any other colorblind friendly implementations possible

## Version 1.0.1 -- August 23rd, 2022

Note: functionally, this release is virtually the same as v1.0

### New in this version

- Created subfiles for `js` and `css` scripts to make `html` files easier to parse
- Minor changes to style in "Astronomical Spectroscopy"
  * Lab no longer named "Astronomical Spectroscopy II"

### Needs to be added to the next version

- Color blind modes for all labs

## Version 1.0 -- August 18th, 2022

The ALEX labs are officially ready for student usage!
I anticipate needing to update *something* before students get their hands on it.

### New in this version:

- You Can Weigh Jupiter
  * Use the motions of the Galilean moons of Jupiter to determine its mass!
- Astronomical Spectroscopy
  * Learn all about how bodies in our universe emit and absorb radiation
- Measure the Hubble Constant
  * Obtain an estimate of the expansion rate of the Universe!

### Needs to be added to the next version

- Clean-up code and other minor adjustments
